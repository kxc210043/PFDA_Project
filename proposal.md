# Title: 
Van vs Zombies

## Repository
Link: https://github.com/kxc210043/PFDA_Project.git 

## Description
I will be creating a 2d pixelated video game of a Van driving through an endless highway avoiding zombies. This project will incorporate 2d pixel art, animation and coding.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- The Van will have a set health but if a zombie hits it the health will decrease. I will execute this by using for loop with a set health, and have a collistion.
- Feature 2
	- The van will be able to move. I will execute this using the pygame addon and specify wasd to be the movement
- Feature 3
	- Game only stops when health is less than 1. I will do this using if functions, collision code and true and false statements

## Challenges
- Need to reasearch how to animate the pixels into the game
- learn how to set up a start and game over menu
- Learn how to make an infinite scrolling background

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome is to have a retro looking game like the starship games in the 80s but with a van driving through different zombies

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The minimal outcome is definetly being able to play the game and no glitch happen.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Research how to have the animated elements
  2. Start/finish the pixel van and zombies

- Week 2
  1. Begin the skeleton of the code
  2. Have the animated elements done

- Week N (Final)
  1. Finish and play test
  2. Hopefully its finished and good
